# Realtime-Motion-Detector
A simple yet effective real-time motion detection system built with Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter GUI. This project tracks movement from a webcam feed and visually highlights it with bounding boxesâ€”ideal for basic security setups, visual tracking demos, or as a foundational tool for research in video analytics.
